# An Introduction to Variational Gaussian Processes

These are the sources for the talk I gave at the [Toronto Probabilistic Programming Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Probabilistic-Programming-Meetup/events/231728607/). They are released under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license, see below.

Read [here](https://github.com/tscholak/presentation_template) about how you can build and view the slides.

For the impatient, I also converted the slides to pdf. Head [here](https://github.com/suhailshergill/ProPL-meetup/tree/master/08_18_Variational_Gaussian_Proces) and download `talk.pdf`. At the same location, you will also find a jupyter notebook, `gaussian_processes.ipynb`, containing a little demo of Gaussian process regression with `pystan`.
